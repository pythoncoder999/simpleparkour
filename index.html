I'll create a simple parkour game for you with HTML and JavaScript. This will be a 2D side-scrolling game where you control a character jumping over obstacles.I've created a simple parkour game for you! Here's what the game includes:

**Features:**
- **Player character** (red square with eyes) that can move and jump
- **Multiple platforms** to jump on at different heights
- **Moving obstacles** (red spikes) that you need to avoid
- **Wall jumping** mechanics for advanced movement
- **Score system** and lives counter
- **Game over screen** with restart option

**Controls:**
- **SPACE**: Jump (when on ground)
- **SHIFT**: Wall jump (when touching a wall)
- **A/D** or **Arrow Keys**: Move left/right
- **R**: Restart game (when game over)

**How to Play:**
1. Jump over or avoid the red obstacles coming from the right
2. Use the platforms to reach higher areas
3. Wall jump for advanced movement
4. You have 3 lives - lose one each time you hit an obstacle
5. Score increases over time and when you successfully avoid obstacles

The game features smooth physics, collision detection, and a nice visual style with animated clouds. You can easily copy this HTML code and paste it into your GitHub Pages repository as `index.html` to make it live on the web!

Want me to add any specific features like power-ups, different obstacle types, or more complex level design?
